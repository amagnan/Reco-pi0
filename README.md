# Reco-pi0
This project focuses on evaluating the reconstruction processes of the neutral pion ($\pi^0$) with different granularities using photon data stored in a ROOT files. These ROOT files are simulation data from events in FCC-ee CLD detector. The $\pi^0$ is identified by calculating the invariant mass of photon pairs from its dominant decay channel $\pi^0 \rightarrow \gamma \gamma$.
