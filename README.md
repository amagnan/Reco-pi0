# Reco‚ÄëœÄ‚Å∞: œÄ‚Å∞ Reconstruction Study in FCC‚Äëee Si‚ÄëW ECAL

This project investigates the performance of neutral pion (œÄ‚Å∞) reconstruction in the CLD detector concept for the FCC‚Äëee, using simulation datasets with varying Si‚ÄëW electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL) cell sizes: 5‚ÄØmm √ó‚ÄØ5‚ÄØmm, 1‚ÄØcm √ó‚ÄØ1‚ÄØcm, 1.5‚ÄØcm √ó‚ÄØ1.5‚ÄØcm, and 2‚ÄØcm √ó‚ÄØ2‚ÄØcm.

## üß™ Overview

- **Simulation**:  
  The process simulated is \( Z \rightarrow \tau^+ \tau^- \), where subsequent tau decays produce neutral pions:  
  \( \tau \rightarrow \pi^0 \rightarrow \gamma\gamma \).  
  The output of each simulation is stored in a ROOT file containing both generator-level and reconstructed photon information. Each event includes the following structure (sample output from `TTree::Show(1)`):

- **Objective**:  
Assess the effect of ECAL transverse granularity on œÄ‚Å∞ ‚Üí Œ≥Œ≥ reconstruction, with a focus on:
- Photon-pairing efficiency and invariant mass resolution
- Photon merging behavior as a function of angular separation (ŒîR)
- Detection thresholds and reconstruction purity
- Implications for data acquisition (DAQ) rates and channel counts

- **Analysis Strategy**:
1. Use ROOT to associate generator-level photons and œÄ‚Å∞s with reconstructed photon objects.
2. Analyze distributions such as:
   - ŒîR between gen-photon and reco-photon
   - Reconstructed invariant mass of photon pairs
   - Energy ratios and threshold effects
   - Number of reco photons vs. œÄ‚Å∞ separation
3. Visualize key observables using histograms, 2D maps, and profile projections.

- **Data**:  
ROOT files containing simulation outputs for each cell size configuration. The analysis compares reconstruction performance across all four granularity setups.
