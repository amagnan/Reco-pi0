# Reco‚ÄëœÄ‚Å∞: œÄ‚Å∞ Reconstruction Study in FCC‚Äëee Si‚ÄëW ECAL

This project investigates the performance of neutral pion (œÄ‚Å∞) reconstruction in the CLD detector concept for the FCC‚Äëee, using simulation datasets with varying Si‚ÄëW electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL) cell sizes: 5‚ÄØmm √ó‚ÄØ5‚ÄØmm, 1‚ÄØcm √ó‚ÄØ1‚ÄØcm, 1.5‚ÄØcm √ó‚ÄØ1.5‚ÄØcm, and 2‚ÄØcm √ó‚ÄØ2‚ÄØcm.

## üß™ Overview

- **Simulation**:  
  The process simulated is \( Z \rightarrow \tau^+ \tau^- \), where subsequent tau decays produce neutral pions:  
  \( \tau \rightarrow \pi^0 \rightarrow \gamma\gamma \).  
  The output of each simulation is stored in a ROOT file containing both generator-level and reconstructed photon information. Each event includes the following structure (sample output from `TTree::Show(1)`):

The goal is to evaluate how ECAL granularity impacts œÄ‚Å∞ ‚Üí Œ≥Œ≥ reconstruction performance, including efficiency, purity, merging effects, and implications for data acquisition (DAQ) requirements. The analysis workflow uses a ROOT-based pipeline to:

- Match reconstructed photons to generator-level photons using angular distance (ŒîR)
- Reconstruct œÄ‚Å∞ candidates from photon pairs
- Compute observables such as ŒîR distributions, invariant mass, energy ratios, and thresholds
- Produce 2D histograms (e.g., number of reco photons vs. œÄ‚Å∞ ŒîR) and profile plots to study detection performance and shower overlap

This study informs detector optimization by quantifying the trade-offs between calorimeter granularity, photon separation power, and reconstruction reliability.
