# Reco‑π⁰: π⁰ Reconstruction Study in FCC‑ee Si‑W ECAL

This project investigates the performance of π⁰ reconstruction using simulation data for different Si‑W calorimeter cell sizes (5 mm × 5 mm, 1 cm × 1 cm, 1.5cm × 1.5cm, and 2cm × 2cm) in the CLD detector concept for FCC‑ee.

## Overview
- **Goal**: Analyze how ECAL granularity impacts π⁰ → γγ reconstruction, purity, efficiency, and limits on DAQ requirements.
- **Approach**:  
  1. Use ROOT-based analysis to match generations (gen-photons and gen-π⁰) with reconstructed photons.  
  2. Examine ΔR distributions, delta-p thresholds, energy ratios, and merging effects.  
  3. Provide 2D histograms (e.g. nReco vs. ΔR) and profile projections to evaluate detection limits.  
- **Data**: ROOT trees from simulation runs with two cell-size configurations.
