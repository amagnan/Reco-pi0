# Reco‚ÄëœÄ‚Å∞: œÄ‚Å∞ Reconstruction Study in FCC‚Äëee Si‚ÄëW ECAL

This project investigates the performance of neutral pion (œÄ‚Å∞) reconstruction in the CLD detector concept for the FCC‚Äëee, using simulation datasets with varying Si‚ÄëW electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL) cell sizes: 5‚ÄØmm √ó‚ÄØ5‚ÄØmm, 1‚ÄØcm √ó‚ÄØ1‚ÄØcm, 1.5‚ÄØcm √ó‚ÄØ1.5‚ÄØcm, and 2‚ÄØcm √ó‚ÄØ2‚ÄØcm.

## üß™ Overview

- **Simulation**:  
 The process simulated is $Z \rightarrow \tau^+ \tau^-$, where $\tau \rightarrow \pi^0 \rightarrow \gamma\gamma$. 
  The output of each simulation is stored in a ROOT file containing both generator-level and reconstructed photon information. Each event includes the following structure (sample output from `TTree::Show(1)`):

miniTree.root is data with photon energy > 0.1 GeV and cell size 5 x 5mm. The other ROOT files has lower energy cut. File end with modifEcal1 corresponds to cell size 1cm, file end with modifEcal1p5 conrresponds to cell size 1.5x1.5cm, and file end with modifEcal2 corresponds to cell size 2x2cm. There are other simulation outputs with one milion events: https://www.hep.ph.ic.ac.uk/~magnan/miniTree_1M.root and http://wwwae.ciemat.es/~cepeda/FCC/miniTree_1M_22Jul.root. They both simulates cell size 5x5mm, but later one has a lower energy cut.

- **Objective**:  
Assess the effect of ECAL transverse granularity on œÄ‚Å∞ ‚Üí Œ≥Œ≥ reconstruction, with a focus on:
-photon matching (gen-level photon and reco-level photon)
-angular & energy resolution
-detector threshold behavior
-energy reconstruction

- **Analysis Strategy**:
1. In "pi0 mass" 

- **Data**:  
ROOT files containing simulation outputs for each cell size configuration. The analysis compares reconstruction performance across all four granularity setups.
